### Project Description
Kai Rekha 2.0 is a parody palm reading website that serves hilariously fake predictions. From sarcastic astrologers to absurd fortunes, it’s 0% accurate but 100% guaranteed to make you laugh.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people take astrology way too seriously. We solve this by giving completely useless, AI-generated predictions so you can stop worrying about your future… and start laughing at it instead.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We combine AI, sarcasm, and random text generators to give you the most gloriously inaccurate predictions of your life — all from fake astrologers you definitely shouldn’t trust.
